# Energy characterization of operations with Hammer

Work in progress.

In an already set up Hammer repo, run the following:

```
  cd hammer/e2e
  git clone https://github.com/nayiri-k/hammer-energy-char.git
  cd hammer-energy-char
  <hammer flow>
```
Jupyter notebooks are found in `experiments/`, but run all hammer commands in the root of this directory.
